  <p>
  Our lectures are a mix of theory and hands-on applications, usually via Python notebooks. This successful recipy provides the necessary variety to keep the interest alive and the students engaged !
  <br><br>
  Our teaching philosophy is to go hand-in-hand with the students so that no one is left behind ! We encourage both teacher-student and student-student interactions.
