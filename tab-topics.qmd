Given that our target students are early-career scientists, our schedule always strikes a balance between "core" topics and "seasonal" ones.
<ul class="mt-0 mb-0">
  <li>Core topics are always part of a school's schedule because they provide the essential foundation for all applications—fundamentals every researcher must master.</li>
  <li>Seasonal topics are state-of-the-art subjects that change from event to event so we can explore new trends in statistics, stay current, and invite dedicated speakers.</li>
</ul>
<br>
This is what we covered so far, along with some subjects we would like to cover in future editions:

Notice that - however complex the topic may be - our notebooks are always meant to provide re-usable code that a student may readily refactor to their purposes with minimal effort !
