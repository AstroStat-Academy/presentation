  <p>
    The target audience that will benefit most from this School is Astrophysics PhD candidates.
    However, we do accept a wide variety of applicants, ranging from BSc students to professors, and from diverse disciplinary backgrounds, including Computer Science, Mathematics, and Signal Processing (to mention a few) - afterall, everybody needs a hand with statistics!
    <br><br>
    At every event, we like to keep the number of attendants constrained (around 30), in order to maximize the interactions between the students and the teachers.
    <br><br>
    We believe the aforementiond choices benefits the School in two ways.
    On one hand, it provides an engaging learning experience by showing how the techniques can be applied across different domains.
    On the other hand, it allows the teachers to address a broader range of needs and stay up to date with the latest developments in Machine Learning.
